#Week 10

###How do we fix the rendering issue with multiple tables
- When I first saw the issue, I immediately went in and tried to fix it, but my first two attempts failed. To set the TBL_OUTPUT to an empty string before rendering a new table, but it didnt work properly. 

- Dang, I should have realised I had to put .innerHTML to reset the value without causing problems.



###Week 10 Assignment 1 Notes:

The code makes perfect sense to me. Great lesson. I definitely got mixed up on the commit messages, but the lesson was very clear. Thanks.
