#Week 10

How do we adjust the code to make the correct items under the correct heading
- We just need to change the order when we pass the data into MY_DATA
- The way to do that is change the object order returned in the trackMPGandCost function



#Feedback about the class:
It is often very difficult to know which commit message you are expecting us to use with what code. For example, this week there is sometimes text under the video and sometimes text over the video, with no clear indication of what text goes with what video. In addition, the commit messages could be used for multiple steps in the process such as 'creating columns' or 'table creation success', so it takes a ton of work to try and decipher what to commit with which message. 
I thought that 'my attempt' was supposed to be the message for the last video, then I realised I hadnt checked if my refactoring worked (it didnt) so then I used 'my attempt without errors'. But now I need to commit again and I cant tell which commit message Im supposed to be using.
In previous lessons, you would say the commit message in the video and that helped to maintain clarity.
Thank you
