# Week 15 Chat GPT

## Prompts

Ive been using ChatGPT occassionally for a few months. 

(As a joke) I asked the bot to write for me five example prompts about javascript concepts and a short paragraph describing whether or not ChatGPT was helpful.
Here's the response: 

'Sure, here are five example prompts a JS student might ask ChatGPT:

-What are some best practices for writing modular and maintainable JavaScript code?
-How can I improve the performance of my JavaScript code, especially when dealing with large data sets?
-What are some popular design patterns used in JavaScript development, and when should they be used?
-How can I effectively use Promises and async/await in my JavaScript code?
-What are some techniques for debugging complex JavaScript applications and tracking down hard-to-find bugs?
ChatGPT can be incredibly helpful for learning JavaScript because it provides a platform for asking questions and receiving answers in a conversational format. Instead of poring over dry documentation or scouring forums for answers, students can interact with ChatGPT in a more natural way, which can help them better understand complex concepts and improve their problem-solving skills. Additionally, ChatGPT's ability to draw from a large knowledge base means that it can provide a range of perspectives and solutions to any given problem, which can be especially helpful when trying to find the best approach to a particular task.'

Here are some examples of prompts from my GPT history:
- "code snippet... getFeed();"
how could a 5 second timeOut be added to the fetch request by adding the smallest amount of characters to the code?
- ...what if i want the timeout error to create a window alert rather than just in the console, and abandon the request?

- Here is a code snippet in JS, do you understand what it is doing?: '...code snippet...'
- ...Correct. I am using this to animate in cards on scroll. But I now would like them to animate out in a similar fashion as they LEAVE the viewport. Can you help?

- Instead of rounding up or down to a whole number with floor or round, how can I get a number that allows a maximum of two digits after the decimal in JS?

- how to disable a button in JS

- What does step="2" mean on an html button?
- ...Can the step be set to 0.01?

At times I have found ChatGPT helpful when building something, and other times it seems to be a rabbit hole, or give answers that dont exactly fit with what I am asking. Overall, an extremely useful tool to have as an option.



## Video

It's interesting to hear what some of the people in the video had to say. In my opinion there will definitely be alot of jobs that are eventually illiminated because of the use of AI. But that has been true throughout history, when certain jobs are illiminated, new jobs appear. And it may be that if technology advances, people will be able to spend less time working, which I dont consider a huge loss. 

Also, there is very little AI that I have seen that does not require a great deal of human input, or actions takern in orde to function on a high level. It is definitely improving at an insane rate, but for example I dont think anyone would be that excited about an AI painter that actually painted on canvas with oil paints. BEcause that painter would not be able to paint a specific painting catered to each target demographic, and even if so it would truly decrease the value of the object by removing th human element. TOtal tangent but just an example of how human will remain involved.

Not sure if you are aware but there is currently a writers strike going on in the film  industry and one of the greinances is the use of AI in writing for television. Personally, I think it is silly to try and fight againt the use of technology. Im sure those writers use a number of AI tools like autocorrect and google search just to name a few.
