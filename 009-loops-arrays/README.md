Week & Notes:
I was already familiar with loops and arrays, so not too much trouble with that. As far as dev tools goes, I learned quite a bit over the last few weeks as far as stepping throught rhe code line by line, hovering to see varibale values, etc.
Im not that familiar withe call stack, so that would be nice to hear some more theory on.
