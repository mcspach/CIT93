Week & Notes:
I was already familiar with loops and arrays, so not too much trouble with that. As far as dev tools goes, I learned quite a bit over the last few weeks as far as stepping throught rhe code line by line, hovering to see varibale values, etc.
Im not that familiar withe call stack, so that would be nice to hear some more theory on.

No issues with any of the concepts this week. 

I think in your calculateSUM function you'd be better of with lowerCamelCase like this: calculateSum()

I understand the piurpose of your refactor, primarily using a helper function to acheive the sum part of the method. Overall, yes it makes it a bit more readable. Since it did not really change the ltngth of the document, it didnt acheive alot but I do see the reasoning. I was unaware that global constans should be written in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
