# Week 16 - Fetch API

First questions: YES! I always go and run the code in the browser and debug if it isnt working.

I decided not to go get the API key because you said it was optional.

NOTES on FETCH and XHR:

- Fetch arrived in 2015 - 2017. (Different browsers)
- XHR is the older version on built-in JS http requests.
- Main difference is that Fetch is Promie-based.
- Fetch pros: native support, no install, modern features and syntax
