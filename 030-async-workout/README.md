# Week 14
Asynchronous Workout App

I used a couplke of setTimeout() and I think its working pretty well.

I see now that I'm coding along, my solution used timouts, but not exactly a callback passecd as an argument.
Having said that, I think my solution is more elegant and functional as a user interface. But since it only uses timeouts rather than callbacks, it doesnt exactly fit the requirements.
Good lesson, I enjoyed getting to try out these concepts.
