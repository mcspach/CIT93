When a user hits submit, we want to pass those variables into the function trackMPGandCost and then run calculateAVG to recalculate those variables. We probably want to change a few things about our funtion that changes the DOM in order that the data gets presented accurately and old data is erased.

Your HTML says 'labels' but as far as I can tell the correct tag is 'label'. I wonder if this causes any issues or whether it works just the same.

I decided to not reuire the price input because there is a default value assigned in the function. 

Also, I had already coded the data types into the form, so I did not include ther parseInt() operation

Yes, I understood it quite well.
