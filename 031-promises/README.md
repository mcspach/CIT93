WEEK 14
Promises

- I have always been so confused about resolve / reject, and finally during this video it clicked and made alot of sense how it can actually be used. 
- I also had no idea that .then automatically passed the data down the chain. I thought you had to do something like .then(data => {return data}) to pass it down.
