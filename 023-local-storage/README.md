# Week 11

This was alot of fun. I have never had the chance to use localStorage, but have always been interested in making use of it. 

Im curious about the end, you mentioned that we had previously been working with volatile data and now we are working with persisent data by making use of localStorage. Im guessing the terms have a wide range of meanings, and that local storage is somewhere in the middle of volatile and persistent... is that correct or am I misinderstanding the vocab?
