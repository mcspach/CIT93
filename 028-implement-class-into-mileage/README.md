# Week 13
## Classes

Part 1: 
I think we should create a class called TRIP that inclkudes the three inputs. Then we can save an instance of Trip each time something is submitted or updated. 
Other than that Im not sure where classes could be used in this app. Because Im not sure that's what you are planning to do Im going to hold off until the next video to actually mess with my code.
