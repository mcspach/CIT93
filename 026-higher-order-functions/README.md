# Week 12
## Higher Order Functions

1. Takes a function as a parameter. OR return a function
2. Pass the funtion as either an expression, or saved in a varibale. But dont call the function when passing.
3. This prevents repetition of the same code, making codepase shorter and simpler.
4. Buttons example shows an example of a function that could be written over and over or just changed based on which item is pased in. 

# Fixing AVG
-Just replaced the varibles with the references to values in the sums object.
-Not having any issues with the updateDOM() call at the end of that block, so Im not sure what you're asking us to fix. My code is rerendering that secion every time the data is updated.
