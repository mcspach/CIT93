# Week 12
## Higher Order Functions

1. Takes a function as a parameter. OR return a function
2. Pass the funtion as either an expression, or saved in a varibale. But dont call the function when passing.
3. This prevents repetition of the same code, making codepase shorter and simpler.
4. Buttons example shows an example of a function that could be written over and over or just changed based on which item is pased in.
