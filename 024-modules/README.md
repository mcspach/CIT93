#Week 11 Refactor with Modules

Question:
Why are you imorting the various JS files into your html? Isnt the whole point of modules that you only need to import the main.js, and all other code will come along with it?

What if we ended up with 900 js files, are we going to import every single one into every single html file? I have only added main.js as an html import thoughout this excercise and never had trouble because of it. By importing the necessary code in the js import statements, I believe we are illiminating the need to import into the html. 

Please correct me if I misunderstand something about this!
