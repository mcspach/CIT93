# Using Devtools

I had completely forgotten about marking breakpoints indside the sources panel and stepping through line by line. This is a huge help and I think it will make me a much better programmer!

I had also forgotten the difference between null and undefined, so this lesson was a good reason to go revisit that concept in the documentation.

Love that you can hover a variable and see the value!
