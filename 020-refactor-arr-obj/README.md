#Week Nine Notes

##CRUD
Create, Read, Update, Delete
(+New, View, Edit, Destory)
Ruby on Rails was my first introduction to developement, and it is mostly intended to create high-functioning CRUD apps with ease.

##renderDOM
- Creates a table with all the data from the mileage form.
- A new data item for each set

## PROJECT
- Create your own simple CRUD app with vanilla JS
- This will be assigned in Week 11

Week 10 -> We may refactor the mileage app (w/ EDIT and DELETE functions?)

#My Input
- Hey Rio, Im not sure if you are asking us all to come up with ideas for CRUD apps, then you will assign one CRUD app for us all to complete, or alternatively that you are asking us each to come up with our own idea and we will build our own.
- I've been interested in trying out Tailwind, would you mind if I import that into some of my class code and play around with styles?
