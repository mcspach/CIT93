#Week 10
- For the delete button, I was able to create functionality pretty easily by copying a few lines from elsewhere.
- There is one persisting error where the Averages get thrown off when I delete a record. 

-I was finally able to solve the delete/averages issue with some tinkering, but there is still a tiny UI issue where I'd like to illiminate the average outputs if the values are NaN, but I didnt quite figure that out.
