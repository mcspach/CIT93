# App for Eating

This application will decide whether or not to eat, and what Macro nutrient to induilge in. It first decides whether or not we are within eating hours, then decides whether or not we are hungry. If those two guards are passed, then the inner loop recommends different options based on which nutrients have been consumed at higher levels that day.

Week 14:
HUGE PROGRESS!
- Now renders a table to the DOM each time the user inputs a new macro count. Each count will eventually have the option to be edited or deleted. 
- Now renders a table to the DOM each time the user inputs a hunger level, which stores the hunger level, message, and time. Eventually the option will be added to delete the hunger level records.
- I am considering whether or not to have the app record previous days and have a tab where you can view a summary of each day. 
- Added bootstrap and some beginning styles.
