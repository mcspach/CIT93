# App for Eating

This application will decide whether or not to eat, and what Macro nutrient to induilge in. It first decides whether or not we are within eating hours, then decides whether or not we are hungry. If those two guards are passed, then the inner loop recommends different options based on which nutrients have been consumed at higher levels that day.
